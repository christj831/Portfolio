  I’m a gamer who accidentally coded their way into full-stack development. When I’m not grinding in-game, I’m grinding backend logic with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Supabase — because what’s more fun than debugging at 2AM? On the frontend, I wield Next.js and React like loot drops, crafting interfaces that (hopefully) don’t break when you click them. My goal? Build apps as smooth as a perfect speedrun and as responsive as your favorite game UI.
